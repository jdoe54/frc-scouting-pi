# frc-scouting-pi

This is the Raspberry Pi portion of the Scouting App developed during February 2019. It includes the code
programmed in Python. This was worked on by myself and 2 other programmers during our time in FRC 1671. It 
is now open for anyone to modify, edit, or use for their own teams.
